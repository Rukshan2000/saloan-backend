# Enhanced Booking Logic Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the improved booking logic implemented for the salon management system. The new logic follows a more robust approach to finding available time slots and preventing booking conflicts.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Continuous Block Detection
- Instead of checking individual time slots, the system now identifies continuous available time blocks
- This prevents fragmented bookings and ensures appointments can span multiple time slots

### 2. Comprehensive Conflict Detection
- Improved overlap detection that handles all edge cases:
  - Proposed slot starts during existing appointment
  - Proposed slot ends during existing appointment  
  - Proposed slot completely contains existing appointment
  - Existing appointment completely contains proposed slot

### 3. Smart Beautician Assignment
- Automatically finds the best available beautician for a set of services
- Considers beautician qualifications (can perform all requested services)
- Supports branch filtering for multi-location salons

## Core Methods

### `getAvailableTimeSlots($beauticianId, $totalDuration, $date)`

**Purpose**: Find all available time slots for a specific beautician on a given date.

**Algorithm**:
1. Get beautician's availability schedule for the day of week
2. For each availability window, find continuous available blocks
3. Generate possible appointment slots within available blocks
4. Verify no conflicts with existing bookings

**Parameters**:
- `$beauticianId`: ID of the beautician
- `$totalDuration`: Total duration needed (in minutes)
- `$date`: Date for the appointment (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Returns**: Collection of available time slots with start/end times

### `findBestAvailableBeautician($serviceIds, $date, $branchId = null)`

**Purpose**: Find the first available beautician who can perform all requested services.

**Algorithm**:
```
for beautician in beauticians:
    available_slots = get_continuous_available_blocks(beautician.schedule)
    
    for block in available_slots:
        if block.duration >= total_service_duration:
            if no_conflicts_with_existing_bookings(block, beautician.id):
                return {
                    beautician_id: beautician.id,
                    start_time: block.start,
                    end_time: block.start + total_service_duration
                }
```

**Parameters**:
- `$serviceIds`: Array of service IDs to be performed
- `$date`: Date for the appointment
- `$branchId`: Optional branch filter

**Returns**: Best available slot with beautician details, or null if none found

### `getAvailableBeauticiansForServices($serviceIds, $date, $branchId = null)`

**Purpose**: Get all beauticians who can perform the services with their available slots.

**Returns**: Collection of beauticians sorted by availability (most slots first)

## API Endpoints

### Enhanced Time Slots
```
GET /api/v1/appointment-services/available-time-slots
Parameters: beautician_id, total_duration, date
```

### Find Best Beautician
```
GET /api/v1/appointment-services/find-best-beautician
Parameters: service_ids[], date, branch_id (optional)
```

### Get Available Beauticians
```
GET /api/v1/appointment-services/available-beauticians
Parameters: service_ids[], date, branch_id (optional)
```

### Smart Booking
```
POST /api/v1/appointments/smart-booking
Body: {
  "customer_id": 1,
  "service_ids": [1, 2],
  "date": "2025-08-05",
  "branch_id": 1
}
```

## Helper Methods

### `getContinuousAvailableBlocks($beauticianId, $date, $windowStart, $windowEnd)`
Identifies continuous time blocks where the beautician is available.

### `generatePossibleSlots($blockStart, $blockEnd, $requiredDuration)`
Generates all possible appointment start times within a time block (15-minute intervals).

### `hasNoConflictsWithExistingBookings($proposedSlot, $beauticianId, $date)`
Comprehensive conflict detection for a proposed appointment slot.

## Benefits

1. **No Booking Conflicts**: Robust overlap detection prevents double-booking
2. **Optimal Resource Utilization**: Finds the best available beautician automatically
3. **Flexible Duration**: Handles appointments of any duration seamlessly
4. **Multi-Service Support**: Books appointments for multiple services with single beautician
5. **Branch Awareness**: Supports multi-location salon management
6. **Performance Optimized**: Efficient algorithms minimize database queries

## Usage Examples

### Basic Time Slot Check
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/appointment-services/available-time-slots?beautician_id=1&total_duration=45&date=2025-08-05"
```

### Find Best Beautician for Multiple Services
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/appointment-services/find-best-beautician?service_ids[]=1&service_ids[]=2&date=2025-08-05"
```

### Smart Booking
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/appointments/smart-booking" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": 1,
    "service_ids": [1, 2],
    "date": "2025-08-05",
    "branch_id": 1
  }'
```

## Testing
